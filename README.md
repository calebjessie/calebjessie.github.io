=====================
This is my latest for my portfolio site.

I used SASS, Compass, Susy, and Breakpoint for the first time ever. I wanted to use a light framework for RWD and using Susy and Breakpoint seemed like a good choice. All though I just recently learned about Bourbon which I'd like to dig deeper into.

I first tried using Foundation but I couldn't stand how bloated it feeled. I didn't like all the extras even though I could choose which modules to use. It didn't sit well with me.

# Tell me what you think

I put my portfolio on here for that exact reason. I want to hear what you think about my code, design, or anything else.

Tell me what you like. If you dislike something, let me know what it is and what you think I should do instead. I'm really eager to hear constructive criticism so I can improve.

# In the near future

Some things that I have yet to do
* Finish adding images for current projects, e.g., instaGC & airo
* Add the redesign of instaGC as a concept since it was never implimented?
* Add a third project if possible
* Rewrite about me copy
* Add Github icon into social links
* Add a new section that better highlights what I have to offer
* Create blog page and start writing
* Adopting a better file structure for CSS; e.g., SMACSS, Pattern lab
